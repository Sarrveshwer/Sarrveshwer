# Hi, I’m Sarrveshwer 👋

I work mostly with **machine learning fundamentals** right now.  
Still early, still learning, but past the “just running notebooks” phase.

I’m moving from classical ML toward **neural networks**, focusing more on
*why models fail* than on chasing accuracy numbers.

## How I approach ML (roughly)
- I default to simpler models unless complexity actually helps
- I’ve broken more models with bad validation than I’ve trained successfully
- Data issues have caused me more trouble than algorithms
- Trying to learn DL from first principles instead of frameworks-first

## Projects
I keep only a few projects public.  
Each one is something I finished and learned from, not a dump of experiments.

(Pinned repos explain more than this README ever will.)
